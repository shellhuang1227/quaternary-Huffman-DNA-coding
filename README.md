# quaternary-Huffman-DNA-coding
This code present the quaternary Huffman coding using for DNA information storage, it translate the binary file to DNA nucleotides with the quaternary Huffman coding. And quaternary Hamming code is used to correct synthesis and sequencing errors with low redundancy. The quaternary Huffman coding based on the statistical properties of information sources can effectively increase the storage density of nucleotide for files with strong statistical characteristics, such as text, image and audio, etc.
